// QUESTION: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. 
// If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
// You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int low = 0 , high = n-1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high)/2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            else if (nums[mid] > target) high = mid-1;
            else low = mid+1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
