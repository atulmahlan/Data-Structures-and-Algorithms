# Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms, written in c++ language.

Overview
This repository is organized by different types of data structures and algorithms, with each type having its own directory. It is designed to help anyone interested in learning and practicing DSA concepts.

Data Structures
1. Arrays
-- Implementations of common array operations and problems.
2. Linked Lists
-- Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists, and common linked list problems.
3. Stacks
-- Stack implementations and problems using stacks.
4. Queues
-- Queue implementations and problems using queues.
5. Trees
-- Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and related algorithms.

Algorithms
1. Sorting
-- Implementations of sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
2. Searching
-- Search algorithms including Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
3. Dynamic Programming
-- Problems and solutions using dynamic programming techniques.
4. Greedy Algorithms
-- Greedy algorithm problems and their solutions.
