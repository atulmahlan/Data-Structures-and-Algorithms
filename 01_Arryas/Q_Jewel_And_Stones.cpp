// QUESTION: You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. 
// Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
// Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        unordered_set<char> jewelSet(jewels.begin(), jewels.end());
        int count = 0;

        for(char stone : stones)
        {
            if(jewelSet.count(stone))
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
